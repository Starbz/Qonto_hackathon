# Qonto Hackathon Project: AI-Driven Chatbot for Transaction Insights
## What's the Feature?
Our chatbot empowers users to interact with their Qonto transaction data via natural language prompts, offering capabilities such as:
- Filtering transactions based on user queries.
- Providing a quick summary of filtered transactions, including total and average amounts.
- Delivering further insights on non-filter queries, like identifying the highest spending team in a specific month.

## Why Build It?
Despite existing transaction filters on Qonto, their complexity can hinder user experience, especially for intricate queries. Our chatbot simplifies this process, enhancing user interaction with their financial data by making it easy to obtain transaction summaries and insights through simple conversational prompts.

## Why Should Qonto Invest?
This feature, while not groundbreaking, is an accessible step towards more sophisticated conversational AI applications within Qonto, potentially leading to the development of more complex functions such as card creation, user additions, and making transactions.

## Technical Details
We've initiated a transformative approach to banking experience by integrating a conversational AI agent that enables natural language interactions with transaction data. This prototype demonstrates the feasibility of expanding such functionalities, focusing on user-friendly data access and insightful analytics.

## Key Components:
**AI Agent Integration:** Utilizing OpenAI's Beta Assistant API for natural language understanding and user interaction.
**Functional Capabilities:** Developed data filtering and analytics functions to process user queries and provide meaningful insights.
**Operational Logic:** Implemented specific prompting logic to ensure the AI agent applies the correct function based on the query.

## Future Directions:
Acknowledging the project's initial scope, we aim to address current API limitations and explore advanced AI platforms for improved performance, envisioning a banking experience that's more interactive and personalized through AI.
